PostgreSQL for datawarehousing <br>
SQL, NumPy, and Pandas for data manipulation and statistical analysis<br>
MS Excel, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data visualization and image design <br>

## BREAKDOWN/EXPLANATION
### KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
#### CONTRACT EXPIRATION TRACKER<br>
This mainly helps to keep track of the contract duration of each active occupant, as well as to easily identify those with expired contracts. It is a dynamic visual representation of how many days left before an active occupant's contract expires.<br>

<br>
#### CUSTOMER RETENTION & OCCUPANCY RATE<br>
<br>
Customer retention rate is a metric for measuring the rate at which occupants are renewing their contracts 
after expiration of the initial one.

<br>
Occupancy rate is a metric for measuring rate at which letting units (shops and land space) are being rented. <br>

<br>
#### EVACUATION RATE, EVICTION RATE, REASONS FOR EVACUATION RANKING <br>
<br>
Evacuation rate is a metric for measuring rate at which occupants are leaving after contract expiration.<br>

<br>
Eviction rate is a metric for measuring rate at which occupants are being evicted with notice
which indicates how much we need the services of a lawyer. This metric has a direct impact on the bottom line in three folds:
<br>  (i) legal costs (ii) lack of revenue generation from the letting unit (iii) loss of opportunity to replace outgoing occupant with potential occupants due to the unavailability of the letting unit.

<br>
Ranking the various reasons given by leaving occupants for evacuating the property is an important indicator for assisting the sales personnel to improve customer retention.

<br>
#### MARKETING MEDIA PERFORMANCE, CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT RATING & VALUABLE PRODUCT RATING <br>
<br>
Ranking the performance of the various marketing media is key when making the decision to deploy funds to the most effective marketing medium. This indicator can help to reduce costs of advertisement.<br>

<br>
Customer Engagement rating gives the information of the most likely month(s) of the year for key customer activities such as making payments, moving in, and evacuation.<br>

<br>
Valuable product rating helps to rank from the least to most valuable letting units. This is a key indicator for creating a effective marketing plan.
