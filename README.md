# Property-Management-Analytics
A sample demonstration of my analytical experience and skills in real estate data-driven management business.
Tools used to execute this task are: <br>
PostgreSQL for datawarehousing <br>
SQL, NumPy, and Pandas for data manipulation and statistical analysis<br>
MS Excel, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data visualization and image design <br>

### OVERVIEW
These are dynamic visual representation for monitoring key performance indicators. The goal is to give managers important information needed to make data-driven and insightful decisions.

## BREAKDOWN/EXPLANATION
### KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
#### CONTRACT EXPIRATION TRACKER<br>
This mainly helps to keep track of the contract duration of each active occupant, as well as to easily identify those with expired contracts. It is a dynamic visual representation of how many days left before an active occupant's contract expires.<br>

<br>
#### CUSTOMER RETENTION & OCCUPANCY RATE<br>
Customer retention rate is a metric for measuring the rate at which occupants are renewing their contracts 
after expiration of the initial one.<br>

<br>
Occupancy rate is a metric for measuring rate at which letting units (shops and land space) are being rented. <br>

<br>
#### EVACUATION RATE, EVICTION RATE, REASONS FOR EVACUATION RANKING <br>
Evacuation rate is a metric for measuring rate at which occupants are leaving after contract expiration.<br>

Eviction rate is a metric for measuring rate at which occupants are being evicted with notice
which indicates how much we need the services of a lawyer. This metric has a direct impact on the bottom line in three folds:
<br>  (i) legal costs (ii) lack of revenue generation from the letting unit (iii) loss of opportunity to replace outgoing occupant with potential occupants due to the unavailability of the letting unit.
